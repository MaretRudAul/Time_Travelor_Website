# A Guide to Time Travel: Prove Your Time-Traveling Powers

Welcome to **"A Guide to Time Travel,"** a unique website designed to give you the tools to demonstrate your time-traveling abilities. With cryptographically secure tokens and future enhancements, this project is your ultimate tool to "prove" the impossible.

## How It Works

The concept is simple yet robust:

### Token Generation

- The website generates a cryptographically secure token every minute.
- Each token is a random 60-character string composed of numbers, uppercase and lowercase letters, and common special symbols.

### Proving Time Travel

- To prove that you time traveled, simply tell someone the token that will be generated at a specific future time.
- The probability of guessing the correct token is negligible, making this method a strong proof of time travel.

### Future Enhancements

- **Login Feature:** A login feature will be added to personalize tokens. With this enhancement, every user will receive unique cryptographically secure tokens tied to their account.
- This will ensure that others can only prove time travel in collaboration with you.

## Features

### Current Features

- **Secure Token Generation:** A new token is generated every minute using cryptographic randomness.
- **Simple and Intuitive Interface:** A clean design allows easy access to the tokens and website functionality.
- **Open Source:** The project is available for everyone to explore, contribute to, and improve.

### Upcoming Features

- **User Accounts:** Log in to generate personalized tokens tied to your account.
- **Enhanced Security:** Tokens linked to accounts will further strengthen the validity of proof.
- **Mobile-Friendly Design:** Optimizations to ensure a seamless experience on all devices.
